# Pinpoint Notes
(Also known as: A Beginner's First Android Project)

## Introduction
This is a basic implementation of an Android note taking app! It features fully-tested add, modify, and remove features, along with a sleek red UI design.

Over the course of 36 hours, I learned the basics of Android development and worked around the annoyances of the Android Development Studio. I also honed my UI / graphical design skills and coding practices.

## Future Features  
I had a lot of fun with this, so I'm hoping to expand it in the future! Here's what I've got planned:

* Share to app (from other apps like Twitter, Youtube, etc) 
* Folders 
* In-text images 
* Export to text file 
* Export to PDF file
